PHP remains the most widespread and popular server-side programming language on the web.
It is installed by most web hosts, has a simple learning curve, close ties with the MySQL database, and an excellent collection 
of libraries to cut your development time. PHP may not be perfect, but it should certainly be considered for your next web application.
Both Yahoo and Facebook use it with great success.

XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends,
consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl 
programming languages.Since most actual web server deployments use the same components as XAMPP, it makes transitioning
from a local test server to a live server possible.

How to install this project to your local maschine:
1) download XAMPP (link : https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
